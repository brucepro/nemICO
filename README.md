Put index.html on an html server somewhere. 


Put ico-monitor.js on a node server somewhere. 

Happy ICO'in

Todo: 
This is non functioning code atm. Will update here when it is usable. 

1. Add in client side addresses and private keys
2. Add in fs storage for hashes so they don't repeat. 
3. clean it up. 

Note: This isn't ready to be used anywhere yet, still needs a couple more hours to get working.
